What is Testing?

Testing is the process of checking the functionality of the application whether 
it is working as per requirements.


What is Unit Testing? 

Unit testing is the testing of single entity (class or method). Unit testing is 
very essential to every software company to give a quality product to their 
customers.


What is Manual Testing? 

Executing the test cases manually without any tool support is known as manual 
testing. 


What is Automated Testing? 

Taking tool support and executing test cases by using automation tool is known
as automated testing. 


What are the disadvantages of manual testing? 

- Time consuming and tedious 
- Huge investment in human resources 
- Less reliable 
- Non-programmable


What are advantages of automated testing? 

- Fast
- Less investment in human resources 
- More reliable 
- Programmable 


What is JUnit? 

JUnit is regression testing framework used by developers to implement unit testing
in Java and accelerate programming speed and increase the quality of code. 


What are important features of JUnit? 

- It is an open source framework 
- Provides Annotation to identify the test methods. 
- Provides Assertions for testing expected results. 
- Provides Test runners for running tests. 
- JUnit tests can be run automatically and they check their own results and 
provide immediate feedback 
- JUnit tests can be organized into test suites containing test cases and even
other test suites. 
- JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is green if test is going fine and it
turns red when a test fails. 


What is a Unit Test Case? 

A Unit Test Case is a part of code which ensures that the another part of code 
works as expected. To achieve those desired results quickly, test framework is 
required. JUnit is perfect unit test framework for java programming language. 


What are best practices to write a Unit Test Case? 

A formal written unit test case is characterized by a known input an by an 
expected output, which is worked out before the test is executed. The known 
input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a 
postcondition. 
There must be at least two unit cases for each requirement: one positive test
and one negative test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement
must have at least two test cases as positive and negative. 


When are Unit Tests written in Development Cycle? 

Tests are written before the code during development in order to help coders 
write the best code. 


Why not just use System.out.println() for testing? 

Debugging the code using system.out.println() will lead to manual scanning of the 
whole output every time the program is run to ensure the code is doing expected 
operations. Moreover, in the long run, it takes lesser time to code JUnit methods
and test them on class files. 


Why does JUnit only report the first failure in a single test? 

Reporting multiple failures in a single test is generally a sign that the test 
does too much and it is too big a unit test. JUnit is designed to work best with 
a number of small tests. It executes each test within a seperate instance of the 
test class. It reports failure on each test. 


What are the core features of JUnit? 

-Fixtures
-Test suites
-Test runners
-JUnit classes


What is a fixture? 

Fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests.
The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed 
environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable.


What is a test suite? 

Test suite means bundle a few unit test cases and run it together. In JUnit, both
@RunWith and @Suite annotation are used to run the suite test. 


What is a test runner? 

Test runner is used for executing the test cases. 


What are JUnit classes? List some of them. 

- Assert: It contains a set of assert methods. 
- TestCase: It contains a test case defines the fixture to run multiple tests. 
- TestResults: I contains methods to collect the results of executing a test case. 
- TestSuite: It is a Composite of Tests.
