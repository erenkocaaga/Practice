		 * Widening primitive conversion is applied to convert either or both operands 
		 * as specified by the following rules. The result of adding Java chars, shorts 
		 * or bytes is an int:
		 * -If either operand is of type double, the other is converted to double.
		 * -Otherwise, if either operand is of type float, the other is converted to float.
		 * -Otherwise, if either operand is of type long, the other is converted to long.
		 * -Otherwise, both operands are converted to type int
